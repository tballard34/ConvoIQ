## Here we can define any tables in our database. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available in the REST and other external protocols.

type Dog @table @export {
	id: ID @primaryKey
	name: String
	breed: String
	age: Int
	tricks: [String]
}
